**Important note**: this tool is currently in alpha, meaning there may be breaking changes
in the future and that it probably isn't ready for production use yet.

---

`avdo` is a command line tool (similar to [`svgo`][svgo]) that optimizes Android
`VectorDrawable` (VD) and `AnimatedVectorDrawable` (AVD) xml files.

## Installation

You can install `avdo` using [npm][npm] using the following command:

```sh
npm install -g avdo
```

## Usage

```text
  Usage: avdo [options] [file]

  Options:

    -V, --version          output the version number
    -s, --string <string>  input VD or AVD string
    -i, --input <file>     input file/directory, or "-" for STDIN
    -o, --output <file>    output file/directory (same as the input file by default), or "-" for STDOUT
    -d, --dir <dir>        optimizes and rewrite all *.xml files in a directory

## Build instructions

If you want to contribute, first be sure to install the latest version of
[`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/) and [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/).
I recommend using [vscode][vscode] as your IDE, as it has great,
out-of-the-box support for TypeScript.

Then clone this repository and in the root directory, run:

```sh
npm install
```

To build the tool, run:

```sh
npm run build
```

To test the tool, run:

```sh
npm run test
```
